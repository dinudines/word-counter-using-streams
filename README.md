# Nodejs Expressjs MongoDB Ready-to-use API Project Structure

A ready-to-use boilerplate for REST API Development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

## Getting started

This is a basic API skeleton written in JavaScript ES2015. Very useful to building a RESTful web APIs for your front-end platforms like Android, iOS or JavaScript frameworks (Angular, Reactjs, etc).

This project will run on **NodeJs** using **MongoDB** as database. I had tried to maintain the code structure easy as any beginner can also adopt the flow and start building an API. Project is open for suggestions, Bug reports and pull requests.

## Features

- Basic Authentication (Register/Login with hashed password)

## Software Requirements

- Node.js **8+**
- MongoDB **3.6+** (Recommended **4+**)

## How to run

### Running API server locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `npm run dev`

```bash
Connected to mongodb:YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
App is running ...

Press CTRL + C to stop the process.
```

**Note:** `YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` will be your MongoDB connection string.

### Creating new models

If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file in `/models/` and use them in the controllers.

### Creating new routes

If you need to add more routes to the project just create a new file in `/routes/` and add it in `/routes/api.js` it will be loaded dynamically.

### Creating new controllers

If you need to add more controllers to the project just create a new file in `/controllers/` and use them in the routes.

## Tests

### Running Test Cases

```bash
npm test
```

You can set custom command for test at `package.json` file inside `scripts` property. You can also change timeout for each assertion with `--timeout` parameter of mocha command.
